## Who I am 👇🏻 

_A photographer, free spirit, casual coder, "jack of all trades", content writer, 80's/90's fanboy, tinkerer of all things tech & web. A small business owner, Daddy to two girls – one of them a Golden Retriever 👀 I am into the outdoors, mountain biking, walking. But also overly sugary snacks I probably shouldn't eat and gaming. I invest into the Apple ecosystem (No, I don't care why you don't). Obviously, I enjoy spending money on expensive hobbies and driving cars really fast, in small country lanes_.

**Your above-average-general-risk-taking-adrenaline-junkie-but-also-introvert**.

## Who I am not 👇🏻

_A "proper" web developer. Someone who cares about negativity. Someone who enjoys small talk. A patient man._

- 💬 Ask me about photography, fatherhood, cars, Golden Retrievers ... you name it.
- 😂 Pronouns: No, thank you.
- 😏 Love at first site: I was born in '87, but I connected to the internet for the first time a very late 2007! Yes, I had the best childhood. Kids these days wouldn't get it.
